            Previously designing large tensegrity structures was too difficult to do by hand, except for the

            are numbered to represent the rigid elements and the edges represent the tensile connections, this
            paper showed that it is possible to generate an L-system grammar and evolve the structures.  It
            further shows that using an evolved method such as this allows for a greater range of valid structures.
            Finally the paper addresses some of the modifications that were needed to adjust for the actual physical
            limitations of the structures}
